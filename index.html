    <p style="font-family: serif;">I still have not found a decent method for editing my website (right now I'm using Kompozer). I
      wanted to use mediaWiki, but I wasn't able to install it on the U
      of T machine running the webhost (I couldn't get it to work with
      sqlite). </p>
    <p style="font-family: serif;">Since I really don't want to edit raw HTML, I'm in the market for
      a better solution. If you have any suggestions for some nice free
      website editors or PHP frameworks, please email them to mmerlini
      on this domain. </p>
    <p style="font-family: serif;">Cheers!
