<h1>Decentralized Oracle</h1>
<p>Go online and search blockchain. Everyone is fawning over how blockchain will revolutionize everything blah blah blah...</p>
<p>I will take this opportunity to direct you to <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/san2018-5.pdf" target="_blank">Hanna Halaburda's excellent article.</a> She points out that there is an unavoidable problem to decentralizing every last government office: the <span style="font-style: italic;">gateway problem</span>. Simply put, how does a decentralized network collect provably true information from the real world?</p>
<p>How, I ask you, will a decentralized blockchain descended from
heaven fix land registry problems? The whole idea is
for every node on the network to verify all information... so how on
Earth is my computer in Toronto supposed to know who really owns a
piece of land in Papua New Guinea? The answer is that it's not possible
without forcing me to go down to Papua New Guinea and doing my own
ivestigation. <br>
</p>
<p>So what exactly <span style="font-style: italic;">can</span> we do? Remember that it is necessary for <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> nodes on the network to be able to verify information (or at least <span style="font-style: italic;">most</span>
of them). So any solution to the gateway problem only exists for
information which is already common knowledge, such as the outcome of a
sports game.</p>
<h2>Incentive-Compatible Feedback Payments<br>
</h2>
<p>The idea is to put up a question, and let members of the public
answer it. For this to work, though, we need to ensure that the people
answering the question will act honestly. For this we need <span style="font-style: italic;">incentive-compatible payments</span>. If you know that you will get more rewards for answering honestly, then that is what you will do.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Centralized Oracles</h2>
<p>So we need to have a system where members of the public can cast a
vote and get a reward. Well, newsflash, stuff like this has existed for
ages. Consider slashdot or stackoverflow, which reward users with
reputation/badges. Consider Khan Academy, which rewards good behaviour
with "energy points". Consider the thousands of webforums which use a
karma/kudos system. You can even consider Wikipedia where there is no
reward whatsoever, apart from the esteem of your peers.</p>
<p>This problem is <span style="font-style: italic;">solved</span>. <br>
</p>
<p>There is only one hitch: all of the above systems are run on a
centralized server (or group of servers) and managed by a single
entity. I guess this is some kind of philosophical conundrum or
something, and our goal is now to <span style="font-style: italic;">de</span>centralize the operator of the reward system.<br>
