<h1>The Proof-of-Work Arms Race</h1>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span>Allow
me to say something controversial: Proof-of-Work is not inefficient.
The usual argument against PoW goes something like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>So much electricity is wasted. Hashing doesn't benefit anybody.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Blockchain isn't scalable because every transaction requires a lot of hashing work.</li>
</ul>
<p>At least from an economic point of view, I don't think it's
reasonable to say that the electricity used in PoW is wasted. Every
miner who hashes, even if they don't produce a block, does contribute
to the usefulness of the system. In some sense, that's the price paid
for decentralization.</p>
<p>Another common argument is this: "Why not replace hashing with
something more useful? And while we're at it, why not use the heat
produced by the computational work to warm us up in the wintertime?" At
first, this seems reasonable. But you see, changing the hashing to
something more useful (as well as using the heat) simply serves to
increase the revenue from mining. Thus, since your expected revenue is
higher, you'll be willing to increase your mining power. This is the
"marginal cost, marginal revenue" principle. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; max-width: 560px;">(EDIT: this doesn't
paint the whole picture. Let's say that right now you're spending
$100/day on mining, and making some amount of profit.Someone comes by
and says that they'll sell you a rig that costs $50 a day to run.
Should you buy it? Well, it depends; would your revenue increase by
more than $50/day? If not, then you will be making less money, even if
your total revenue is increased. In the case of doing useful work with
PoW, you would only increase your hashing power as long as the expected
<span style="font-style: italic;">increase </span>in revenue is higher
than your increase in costs. My argument is that you would still
increase your hashing power if it had secondary uses)<br></p>
<p>The last misconception is to say that bitcoin is slow because of
PoW. This is not really true. Actually, it's up to the blockchain's
developer to decide on the block time (i.e. the expected amount of time
between blocks). In bitcoin this was set to 10 minutes (I'm not aware
of the reason) and in Ethereum it is 12 seconds. In Ethereum's case,
this was about the lowest they could push it; if you let your block
time get too short, then the network latency will cause a tremendous
amount of forks. I talk about this is more detail on the <a href="throughput.html">throughput page</a>.</p>
<h2>"I still find it hard to believe that PoW isn't inefficient"</h2>
<p>Well, I can't blame you for thinking that. It's a fact that it
consumes a lot of energy, and likely a lot more than is theoretically
required. And the title of this page should hint at what's coming
next...</p>
<p>Here is the hypothesis: Nakamoto consensus is a very clever
innovation in distributed databses which, among other things, makes
cryptocurrencies possible. Proof-of-Work is necessary in Nakamoto
consensus, <span style="font-style: italic;">but the "arms race" isn't!</span></p>
<h2>The Game Theory Behind Arms Races/PoW</h2>
<p>Most of this is directly copied from William Spaniel's excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9f5z0Lc888">Game Theory 101 video</a>.
Consider two countries (A and B) that have an equal amount of weapons.
Should either of the countries start spending on more weapons?</p>
<p>If country A buys weapons, and country B doesn't, then A has now
gained an advantage and B is at a disadvantage. If both countries buy
weapons, then both countries have essentially wasted money (but this is
not as bad as letting the other country gain the upper hand). If
neither country buys weapons, then everything stays the same. Let's
organize this into a payoff matrix:</p>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">A/B<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Don't Buy<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Buy<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Don't Buy<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">0 / 0<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">-2 / 2<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Buy<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">2 / -2<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">-1 / -1<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>This situation is very reminiscent of buying hashing power. If you
buy more, and your competition doesn't, then you gain an advantage over
them. If nobody buys more, then nothing changes. If everyone buys more,
then everyone is essentially wasting money!<br>
</p>
<p>It doesn't take long to notice that this is a classic Prisoner's
Dilemma situation. All miners will continue to buy more hashing power
despite very diminishing returns in revenue, since that is a dominant
strategy. What we see here is an inefficient Nash equilibrium.</p>
<h2>Is it Possible to Lower Bitcoin's Energy Usage?<br>
</h2>
<p>Absolutely! All you have to do (it's really nothing) is get all
miners on the planet to give up half of their hashing power. Easy! All
miners would continue to earn the exact same revenue, but only pay half
the electricity costs!<br></p>
<p>
So clearly no miner would ever agree to sell off half of their hashing
power. If they did, they would be more vulnerable to losing revenue in
the future if e.g. more miners joined the network. Also, each miner
thinks to themselves "I will make way more money if I'm the only one
who doesn't cut their power in half". Game theory keeps coming back to bite us.</p>

<p>Right now I see two options that might be worth looking into.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Coming up with some fancy PoW function that guarantees all miners have roughly equal power. I have <span style="font-style: italic;">no</span> idea how this would work.</li>
  <li>In a permissioned system, you could simply count the number of blocks one miner is accumulating. Contrary to an arms race (where
the only way to equalize would be for all other miners to match power)
you could simply adjust the difficulty parameter for that one miner.
There was a paper published about this recently, but I can't quite find
it at the moment. Hopefully I'll remember to link it in in the near
future.</li>
</ol>
<p>One reason PoW works so well is because it is virtually impossible
for one person to hold up the whole system (i.e. some kind of DoS
attack). In PoS, PoA, Algorand, etc. there are cases where you can
temporarily disrupt block creation by simply not participating. So if
we found an automatically-adjusting PoW function, we would like it to
maintain this robust liveness.</p>
