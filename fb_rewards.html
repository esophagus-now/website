<h1>Incentive Compatible Feedback Rewards</h1>
<p>A few months ago my supervisor's group (not including me, since I
hadn't started yet) produced what was essentially the first
decentralized blockchain oracle. They named it <font style="font-variant: small-caps;">Astraea</font>, after the Greek goddess of innocence. You can find the paper <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e6f9/77049b78664a485ffe6b671c41bd2cef125f.pdf">here</a>. Shortly after its publication, someone
by the name of Ryuuji Kamiya announced <a href="https://gitlab.com/shintaku-group/paper/raw/master/shintaku.pdf">Shintaku</a>,
which is essentially an improved version of <font style="font-variant: small-caps;">Astraea</font> (complete with working smart
contract code).</p>
<p>The main idea is to ask a question, and let anybody on a public
blockchain answer it. We incentivize honest answers with incentive
compatible rewards. That is, anyone who wants to participate is
guaranteed that honest voting is the best strategy to maximize payoffs.
Thus, if a few hundred people answer a question, and we know that they
knew that honesty was literally the best policy, then we can feel very
confident that the final output is trustworthy.</p>
<p>This article is a sort of "staging area" for information that will eventually get into the <a href="Decentralized_Oracle.html">decentralized oracle</a> page.</p>
<h2><font style="font-variant: small-caps;">Astraea</font>'s Architecture</h2>
<p>The following figure is stolen from the original paper. <span style="font-style: italic;">Comment:
I think everyone should put a figure like this in their papers. Every
moving part is summarized in one diagram, which makes reading the paper
easy and fruitful. It also ends up being a great way to quickly remind
yourself how something works.</span><br>
</p>
<p><img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 500px; height: 312px;" alt="" src="images/astraea.png" hspace="50"></p>
On the left we have the proposition list. Each entry is a proposition
(i.e. a yes/no question) and its associated bounty (i.e. a payment sent
by that proposition's original submitter, used as the source of
payments to voters).<br>
<p>
On the bottom we have the participants, the people who actually provide answers to questions. The participants can be <span style="font-style: italic;">voters</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">certifiers</span>.
As indiciated by the arrows to/from the proposition list, a voter $i$
receives a random proposition $r$, to which they submit their vote $v$
and a stake $s_{i,r,v}$. Certifiers are similar to voters, except that
they do not receive a random proposition. Instead, they simply submit a
stake $\sigma_{i,j,c}$ and a vote $c$ to a proposition of their choice
($j$).</p>
<p>There is two more major differences between voters and certifiers. First, there is a relatively small <span style="font-style: italic;">maximum</span>  stake for voters, whereas there is a relatively large <span style="font-style: italic;">minimum</span> stake for certifiers. As shown by the dotted boxes, a participant may choose to be both a voter and a certifier.
Secondly, voters are rewarded directly by the bounty sent by the
proposition's submitter, whereas certifiers are rewarded from the <span style="font-style: italic;">reward pools</span> (shown on the top right as a pot for true answers and a pot for false answers).</p>
<p>The purpose of sending a stake with every vote is to enable penalties. It is not enough to simply reward honesty <span style="font-style: italic;">more</span>
than any other strategy; bad behaviour should have a sub-zero reward.
Otherwise, even though honest behaviour might be a more fast/efficient
way to make money, a dishonest user could still make profits by acting
lazily/maliciously.This is undesirable. Note that it is the penalties that are used to fill the reward pools. </p>
<p>Birefly, after voting is finished on a proposition, the majority
answers from both voters and certifiers are compared. If they are the
same, we can hand out rewards. Otherwise, we will not output any answer
for that question (in some sense, a disagreement between voters and
certifiers signals that the issue is contentious or that honest and
dishonest voters were fighting over the answer). There are separate
true and false reward pools for certifiers, which are filled if the
majority vote was false or true (respectively).Separating the rewards by answer
acts to fight against a lazy equilibrium, where everyone always votes
true and trivially achieves maximum rewards (and no one wants to
provide an honest "false" answer or else they'll get penalized).</p>
<p>I make <span style="font-style: italic;">no claim</span> that I have fully or even correctly explained <font style="font-variant: small-caps;">Astraea</font>. As far as academic papers go, this one is well written and fairly easy to read, so I refer you there for the proper details.</p>
