<h1>Scalabilty in Distributed Ledger
Technology </h1>

<p><i>Thanks to John Adler and Ryan
Berryhill who </i><i>explained this to me. </i></p>

<p>Everybody knows it...
cryptocurrencies have problems with scalability. To fix scalability, we
need to replace the slow, power-hungry Proof-of-Work with the fast,
svelte Proof-of-Stake, right? </p>

<p><b>WRONG!</b> <i>Proof-of-Work is
not the source of the scalability problem, and Proof-of-Stake will not
solve it! </i></p>

<p>Here is how I define the
scalability problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The amount of work <b>each</b> node in a distributed ledger
must do is O(n) in the number of transactions on the network.<i> </i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The strong safety guarantees in the
face of total decentralization carry a cost: <i>each and every node</i>
must validate <i>each and every transaction</i>. Defined in this way,
we can distinguish two types of scalability solutions:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Not forcing all nodes to validate all transactions</li>
  <li>Somehow changing the O(n) time to validate all transactions, maybe through parallelization.
</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">(Secret option: combine both of
these)</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>Not forcing all nodes to validate
all transactions: Sharding</h2>
<p>Sharding makes use of the (fairly obvious) idea that maybe we really
don't need every single node to validate every single transaction. One
thousand valdidations ought to be enough for anyone! Maybe we can
"shard" the network into smaller pieces that each take care of their
own subset of all transactions? </p>
<p>Implementing sharding is really not easy, mind you. How do you
select which nodes will validate a particular transaction? What happens
if one ore more of those nodes go offline or are dishonest? How will
transaction fees be distributed?</p>
<p>Ethereum's end goal has always been to incorporate sharding, and they have a <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQs">great big FAQ page</a> which should satisfy your immediate curiosity.</p><h2>Improving O(n) Validation Time</h2>
<p>Consider this: if validating transactions was instantaneous, then
maybe blockchain wouldn't suck. In this case, blocks could be
arbitrarily large, and get validated in seconds. You would have all the
benefits of a global, totally decentralized ledger, without the
comparatively high costs and slow transaction times.</p>
<p>We can further classify this class of solutions into two categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reducing validation work by a constant factor</li>
  <li>Reducing the complexity class</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">
Reducing Work by a Constant Factor</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The most immediately obvious method of reducing validation work is to parallelize it. Vitalik has suggested <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/648">doing this for Ethereum</a>, but Ethereum really does not lend itself well to parallelization.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">One idea would be to create an all-new
blockchain platform specifically designed to accommodate a high degree
of parallelizability. If a smart contract language is desired, this
would require designing an all-new VM, possibly disallowing
Turing-completeness. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">A complementary idea would be some kind of hardware acceleration. </p>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">Reducing the Complexity Class</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">This seems unlikely, and I certainly have
no ideas for how to do this. Basically, if you could somehow validate a
list of n transactions in O(lg(n)) time or something, then you would
have solved the scalability problem very directly.</p>
<h2>Secret Option: Both</h2>
<p>To be sure, either one of the previously presented solutions would
probably be sufficient. However, it's interesting to note that
developments in either area are orthogonal; that is, they could easily
be used at the same time, offering even faster/cheaper transaction
validation.</p>
