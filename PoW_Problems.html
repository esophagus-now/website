<h1>Problems with Proof-of-Work</h1>
<p>We all know that Proof-of-Work consumes tons of electricity. It's
easy to say that because a lot of work in Bitcoin simply becomes heat
(and doesn't directly result in the addition of a new block) that
Proof-of-Work is inefficient. <br>
</p>
<p>Well, I can agree that Proof-of-Work produces a lot of unnecessary heat, but I'd like to properly frame the discussion.<br>
</p>

<h2>Satoshi Nakamoto's Contribution<br>
</h2>
<p>Tell me, what was Satoshi Nakamoto's technical contribution that made Bitcoin possible? Why, blockchain of course.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOPE!</span> Blockchains, which are nothing more than information published in discrete blocks which reference the hash of
earlier blocks, have existed for decades. Consider this <a href="https://www.anf.es/pdf/Haber_Stornetta.pdf">application of blockchains to digital timestamping</a> from the year 1991 (5 years before I was born).<br>
<br> Okay, maybe it was the idea of a distributed ledger? No, distributed
database software has also existed for decades. While the idea of
having a publicly-joinable distributed database keeping track of
transactions may have been novel, alone it would not have made Bitcoin
possible, since it did not solve the double spend problem.</p>
<p>Oh, well then obviously Satoshi solved the double spend problem, and <span style="font-style: italic;">that's</span>
what made Bitcoin possible. Still no! Technically he didn't solve
the double spend problem; that was solved decades ago with Byzantine
fault-tolerant algorithms. Here is <a href="http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf">one such algorithm which gained traction in the 90s</a> (I believe it is currently used by Hyperledger, but I haven't checked that fact).</p>
<p>From the title of this page, you can probably guess where I'm headed
with this. Satoshi Nakamoto invented Proof-of-Work, and maybe <span style="font-style: italic;">that's</span> what made Bitcoin possible. Not quite... he didn't invent Proof-of-Work, but we're finally on the right track.</p>
<h2>Nakamoto Consensus</h2>
<p>Satoshi's big idea was using Proof-of-Work (i.e. an irrefutable
proof that your computer completed a large number of operations) as a <span style="font-style: italic;">consensus mechanism</span>.</p>
<h3>Proof-of-Work for Spam Reduction<br>

</h3>

<p>One early application of Proof-of-Work was to cut down on e-mail
spam. A proof-of-work problem could be designed to take a few seconds
on an ordinary computer, and every time you sent an e-mail, you could
include proof that your computer did the work. For regular e-mailing
needs, the few seconds of computer time is no problem. If you're an
e-mail spammer on the other hand, sending thousands of e-mails and
including a proof of work on each one would start to get expensive.</p>

<p>I suppose the idea was that e-mail clients would start rejecting
e-mails that didn't have proof of work, but for whatever reason this
never caught on. Too bad, it seems like a good idea.</p>
<h3>What Would Happen if Bitcoin Suddenly Stopped Requiring Proof-of-Work?</h3>
<p>In my opinion, the best way to understand the role of Proof-of-Work
in Bitcoin is to consider what happens without it. Let's write down the
series of steps that would need to occur for a transaction to be
validated in this scenario:</p>
<ol>
<li>A user creates a transaction, and sends it to the network</li><ul><li>This transaction (along with many others) are distributed to the entire Bitcoin network through some peer to peer protocol<br><br></li></ul><li>Miner nodes validate all incoming transactions by "testing" them against their local copy of the blockchain.<br><br></li><li>Miner nodes assemble a number of valid transactions into a block, and sends it out to the network. <span style="font-style: italic;">They will add this newest block to the end of the longest chain of blocks they are aware of. </span>Shorter chains are summarily rejected.<br></li><ul><li>These blocks are distributed to the entire Bitcoin network through some peer to peer protocol<br><br></li></ul><li>Nodes
receiving a newly published block ensure it is valid. If so, they keep
it. Once several more blocks are added on top of it, they can be pretty
sure it now belongs to an unalterable history</li>
</ol>
<p>The only difference between this procedure and the procedure
involving proof of work is a missing instruction is step 3: after
assembling the transactions, the miner finds the nonce that causes the
block hash to be below the target difficulty.</p>
<p>So what's wrong with this approach?<br>
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Problem 1: Highly divergent histories</span><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">In this scenario, producing a block is
very fast, and crucially, takes all miners on the network roughly the
same amount of time to compute. This means that in step 3 thousands and
thousands of new blocks are being sent out, and many of them will be
different from the rest. When it comes time to add a new block, there
are thousands of chains of equal length... which one do you choose? You
could say that this is a significant lack of consensus, in that
everybody is arguing for their own personal view of reality.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Problem 2: Easy history rewrite attack</span><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">There's another large problem: any miner M can go to a block B in the past, and
very quickly invent a number of fake blocks on top of B. This would
create a new chain off of B, and if M can outrun everybody else (who
are currently having a big argument over the true history)then M's fake blocks would be accepted. This is not good. </p>
<p>Proof-of-Work solves problem 1 by ensuring that there are only a
small handful of possible chains to work on at any given time. How so?
Because solving Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work puzzle is pretty much random
chance. All the miners are "buying lottery tickets" (every nonce they
pay the electricity costs to try entitles them to one chance to hit the
jackpot) and the odds of two miners finding a nonce around the same time is much lower. <br>
</p>

<p>Problem 2 is solved by... solving problem 1. In order to mount a
successful history rewrite attack, you must be able to produce new
blocks faster than the "honest" chain can produce them. In the worst
case, having n possible chains to mine from (i.e. there are n chains
currently of equal length) divides Bitcoin's combined hashing power
into n equal parts. Provided that the sum total hashing power divided
by n is still larger than any one malcious entity's hashing power, the
honest chain will grow faster and a history rewrite attack is virtually
impossible. This is why reducing the number of possible chains (a.k.a.
"soft forks") also acts to prevent these attacks.</p>
<h3>Why is Bitcoin's Block Time 10 Minutes, but Ethereum's is 12 Seconds?</h3>
<p>It's important to note that Proof-of-Work blockchains are dynamically setting a difficulty parameter to ensure a relatively constant (expected) block time. <br>
</p>
<p>Right now I can't give a concrete answer to why these particular times were chosen. One thing I <span style="font-style: italic;">can</span>
say though is that the expected block time has to be longer than the
expected time to distribute a block in the network. Otherwise, we're
back to problem 1 in the last section (highly divergent histories),
which of course leads to problem 2 (easy history rewrite attacks).<br>
</p>
<h2>Nakamoto Consensus vs. BFT Algorithms</h2>
<p>I'm not sure how to approach this right now. BFT algorithms have
large communication overhead, and bitcoin has an expected number of
nonces to try. Some BFT algorithms don't ensure liveness, but then
again neither does Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
