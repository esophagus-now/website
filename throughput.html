<h1>Increasing Blockchain Transaction Throughput</h1>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Thanks to Neil Veira and John Adler who talked this through with me.</span></p>
<p>Everybody has heard this statistic a million times: "Visa can handle
twelve quadrillion transactions per second but Bitcoin only pushes one
through during a full moon" (direct quote from Queen Elizabeth II
herself).</p>
<p> Right now blockchain sucks. Transactions are too slow and too expensive, and there's no two ways about it.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Major Players in the Throughput Game<br>
</h2>

<p><img alt="" src="images/blockdiagramthing_numbered_v2.png">
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Block Time:</span> The (expected)
amount of real time it takes to mine a new block. In Bitcoin and
Ethereum (which use Proof-of-Work) the network dynamically controls a
difficulty parameter to keep expected block times at 10 minutes and 12
seconds respectively. In a Proof-of-Stake system, the block time could
be a lot easier to accurately control, but there would be issues
involving synchronizing clocks.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Block Size:</span> I'm being deliberately vague here. Block
size is a metric for "how much stuff" is in a block. In Bitcoin, you
could say that it is the number of transactions. In Ethereum, you could
say it is the total gas. The problem with just using a size in bytes is
that it isn't representative of the amount of work that block performs.
Just a few bytes in Ethereum could be EVM code for a loop with a
million iterations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Validation Rate:</span> This is the
number of transactions which can be validated per unit time. I'm not
sure if this is wholly meaningful for Ethereum, where "total gas value
of transactions per unit time" may be a better metric. Anyway, this is
a qualitaative discussion so try not to get mired in the details.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Network Latency:</span> I'm not
sure exactly what quantity this should represent. You could say it's
the average time to send 1 kB to a peer on the network, or you could
say it's the average time for 1 kB to reach <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> peers on the network. I'll come back and fix up this definition when I have a better idea myself.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Transaction Throughput:</span> The
holy grail, that most coveted of all achievements. The average
Transactions per Second (TpS) your blockchain is capable of pushing
through. Once again, TpS may not be a meaningful metric for all
blockchain platforms. Ethereum's speed may be better characterized by
how many <span style="font-style: italic;">computations</span> per second it is pushing through (which is measured in units of gas/second).</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Relationships:</p>
<ol>
  <li>For reasons discussed in more detail below, you will want to set
your block time to be greater than the network latency by some safety
margin. In PoW blockchains, this is necessary to prevent a large amount
of orphaned blocks, and in PoS you need to make sure everybody has seen
a block before selecting the creator of the next one.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>This link is due to miner economics. Although I'm not entirely
sure how to analyze this yet, miners will usually strike a balance
between including a lot of transaction in order to increase the
transaction fees they collect, but not including so many so as to
lengthen validation. The longer a miner spends validating, the less
time is available to compute hashes. Furthermore, other miners in the
network are less likely work off a large block since <span style="font-style: italic;">they</span> will have to perform the validation as well.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Although you can do some really tricky things to mitigate this
effect, having larger blocks (and therefore larger amounts of data to
broadcoast among nodes) does increase the expected amount of time for
communication.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Finally,
transaction throughput is essentially (Block Size ÷ Block Time). Please
resist the urge to split hairs; this is a qualitative discussion only!<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Nuances of Choosing a Block Time</h2>
<p>Most (if not all) PoW blockchains just choose a block time and the
network dynamically updates its difficulty in order to maintain it. We
will assume this model for the rest of the discussion.</p>
<h3>PoW Block Time Probability Distribution</h3>
<p>To the best of my understanding, in a Proof-of-Work blockchain the
block times are governed by an exponential distribution. To rigorously
justify this is tricky (especially for me, since I'm very unsure when
it comes to stats) but I'll have to come back to this another time
anyway.</p>
<p>So let's start with the PDF and CDF of an exponential distribution, with Bitcoin's mean of 10 minutes:</p>
